  kev_ger.1.d:0 "Old tensions seemed to have flared up between Austria and France, as Austria has announced an intervention against France following their recent declaration of war. With the major German powers now aligned against France, what was promised to be a quick war may now spiral into a wider conflict."

  kev_ger.2.t:0 "The German Unification War"
  kev_ger.2.d:0 "The recent outbreak of war between [X21.GetName] and [WGR.GetName] signals one of the final battles for German supremacy between two of the region’s most formidable states. Although the Austrians, also ethnically German, haven’t gotten involved in the conflict yet, we believe it to be almost inevitable. As such, we have a choice to make. We need to decide which of the German powers is most likely to align with our interests, and then support them accordingly."
