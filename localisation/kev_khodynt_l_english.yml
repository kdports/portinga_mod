  kev_khodynt.6.d:0 "Little escapes the notice of Lavrentiy Beria. Head of the Khodyntan Commissariat for Internal Affairs (K.V.D.), the nation’s foremost investigative agency, Beria has made it his job to know everything about everyone in Khodynt. Under his watch, the K.V.D. has transformed itself from a crime-fighting bureau to a ruthless secret police organization, constantly feeding information on political dissidents to the higher levels of power. President Kerensky, for his part, has done his best to roll back Beria’s empowerment of the K.V.D. and return it to an investigative agency. As such, his most recent budget includes a severe reduction in K.V.D. funding, a penultimate measure aimed at neutering Beria’s dreams of a fully-fledged secret police.\n\nBeria has no intention of going quietly however, and has begun to plot a military coup to overthrow Kerensky and install a more rigid Proletarian Dictatorship led by himself."
