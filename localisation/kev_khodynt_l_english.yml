  kev_khodynt.4.d:0 "Diplomats from [event_target:nuke_share_target.GetName] have recently approached our ambassador, asking about the possibility of a joint nuclear program. Although this would significantly speed up our own nuclear research, it would have the unfortunate effect of aiding theirs as well.

  kev_khodynt.6.t:0 "The Ambitions of Lavrentiy Beria"
  kev_khodynt.6.d:0 "Little escapes the notice of Lavrentiy Beria. Head of the Khodyntan Commissariat for Internal Affairs (K.V.D.), the nation’s foremost investigative agency, Beria has made it his job to know everything about everyone in Khodynt. Under his watch, the K.V.D. has transformed itself from a crime-fighting bureau to a ruthless secret police organization, constantly feeding information on political dissidents to the higher levels of power. President Kerensky, for his part, has done his best to roll back Beria’s empowerment of the K.V.D. and return it to an investigative agency. As such, his most recent budget includes a severe reduction in K.V.D. funding, a penultimate measure aimed at neutering Beria’s dreams of a fully-fledged secret police.\n\nBeria has no intention of going quietly however, and has begun to plot a military coup to overthrow Kerensky and install a more rigid Proletarian Dictatorship led by himself."

We have a vested interest in maintaining a government type similar to our own, and backing that faction could pay off. On the other hand, there's no guarantee that our investment will benefit us, making this proposition somewhat risky."

  kev_khodynt.9.d:0 "Shocking news from [X13.GetName] today, as gunmen attacked President Kerensky's motorcade, killing both him and his bodyguards. Nearby police units arrived shortly afterwards, making short work of the attackers, but by then the damage had been done. Lavrentiy Beria, Kerensky's intelligence head, has been sworn in as the interim president, vowing to bring stability in this time of crisis."
