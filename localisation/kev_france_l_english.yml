  # Events
  kev_france.1.t:0 "Responding to Italian Demands"
  kev_france.1.d:0 "Now that the Pope has made his intentions known, it’s time we do the same. We can accept military confrontation as inevitable and begin to prepare, but the option of a peaceful resolution has not been ruled out."
  kev_france.1.a:0 "We Shall Never Surrender!"
  kev_france.1.b:0 "We Surrender."

  kev_france.2.t:0 "The Pope Announces a Crusade"
  kev_france.2.d:0 "Yesterday, the Pope called on Catholics across the world to flock to the Vatican in preparation for a Crusade for the now-French region of Piemonte. Tensions have brewed over the region since the French seizure of it in the late 19th century, during the French War of Redemption. The bellicosity of Papal Italy has alarmed many nations, but already volunteers have flocked there from the largely-Catholic England and Spain. Only time and God can tell how this will end..."
  kev_france.2.a:0 "It seems Italian Unification is not yet complete..."

  kev_france.3.t:0 "The French Army Collapses"
  kev_france.3.d:0 "Shocking news from Piemonte this morning, as reporters at the warfront have relayed a general rout of the French army. A mixture of Papal zeal and good planning seem to have outwitted and broken up the French positions, forcing them to make an uncontrolled retreat from the region. This is entirely unexpected, and casts doubts on the capability of the French to fight even a short war."
  kev_france.3.a:0 "How could this happen?"
  kev_france.3.b:0 "Has a second downfall begun?"

  kev_france.4.t:0 "Catholicism Defeated"
  kev_france.4.d:0 "Catholic zeal seems to have meant little at the end of the day, as French armies have soundly defeated the Crusade for Piedmont. The Pope has called an emergency session of Cardinals, and many of the Papal volunteers have fled back to their home countries. This has strongly solidified the French government’s position abroad and at home, and reminded the world who the hegemon is."
  kev_france.4.a:0 "As expected!"
  kev_france.4.b:0 "The Hegemon seems to still reign supreme."

  kev_france.5.t:0 "Italian Negotiations"
  kev_france.5.d:0 "Now that we've agreed to give up Piemonte, the only question that remains is what we'll demand in return..."
  kev_france.5.a:0 "Mutual guarantees will help us in the future."
  kev_france.5.b:0 "Industrial subsidies will smooth out our economy."

  kev_france.6.t:0 "Aiding Our Fellow Catholics"
  kev_france.6.d:0 "As one of the foremost majority-Catholic powers in the world, it’s eyes are now on us for how we’ll respond to the Pope’s recent call for a Crusade against France. Although direct intervention is certainly off the table, we can choose to seriously bolster Papal forces, and perhaps deal a serious blow to France."
  kev_france.6.a:0 "Of course we will help!"
  kev_france.6.b:0 "We just can't spare anything."

  kev_france.7.t:0 "Runup to the 1936 Elections"
  kev_france.7.d:0 "The 1936 elections, scheduled for mid-June, will pitch three primary candidates and their parties against each other. Foriegn policy is the keystone issue in the race, with all three parties basing their platforms on it. With Castellane choosing to step down as the head of the Central Party, Emile Muselier, the party deputy and a distinguished former navy officer, has vowed to lead the country, with a strong focus on reinforcing the empire abroad. Their main opposition is the French Action Party, led by Henri D. Orleans, a jingoistic former representative. Orleans advocates for a more bellicose foriegn policy, arguing that any compromise with France’s enemies is compromising France itself. The People’s Party stands as an unlikely third option in the race, basing its platform off cooperation and negotiation in difficult foriegn situations, with renewed domestic investment and growth at home."
  kev_france.7.a:0 "Interesting"

  kev_france.8.t:0 "The 1936 Elections"
  kev_france.8.d:0 "The polling places are open! Across the metropol, people flock to their voting places, casting votes for the party they think best. As the night wears on, the tally is slowly counted. And the winner is..."
  kev_france.8.a:0 "Emile Muselier, the man of the empire!"
  kev_france.8.b:0 "Henri D. Orleans, a strong man for a tough world!"
  kev_france.8.c:0 "Albert Chatalet, let's give peace a chance!"

  kev_france.9.t:0 "Central Party Victorious!"
  kev_france.9.d:0 "Defying few expectations, France's Central Party has won a deft victory in the most recent elections. Emile Muselier, the recently chosen head of the party, has vowed to reinforce and defend the French Empire abroad. International observers are expecting a mixed stance of appeasement from the new government."
  kev_france.9.a:0 "For all their troubles, France endures."

  kev_france.10.t:0 "Victory for the Action Party!"
  kev_france.10.d:0 "Winning an upstart victory against the former Central Party government, Henri Orleans' Action Party has declared victory in the most recent French elections. The aggresively-minded party leaders have promised to stand up to France's enemies, and never back down from a challenge. Their right-wing politics are seconded only by their small-government economics. Analysts predict a tumultuous next few years, as the rest of Europe learns to manage this new threat."
  kev_france.10.a:0 "For all their troubles, France endures."

  kev_france.11.t:0 "People's Party Snatches Victory!"
  kev_france.11.d:0 "Shocking observers across the world, Chatalet's People's Party has grasped victory in the most recent French elections. Their platform was based entirely off a peaceful and conciliatory approach towards both domestic and foreign policy, and was expected to be a tough sell to the French people. Nevertheless, experts predict a more peaceful France and, hopefully, a more peaceful world."
  kev_france.11.a:0 "For all their troubles, France endures."

  kev_france.12.t:0 "France Demands Wallonie!"
  kev_france.12.d:0 ""
  kev_france.12.a:0 "Accept"
  kev_france.12.b:0 "Refuse"

  kev_france.13.t:0 "Wallonie Surrendered"
  kev_france.13.d:0 "Stunning news from Germany today, as the West German Federation has agreed to peacefully transfer the state of Wallonie back to French hands. Taken from them during France’s Downfall period in the early 19th century, Wallonie had long been a source of tension for the Rhineland powers.\n\nConcerned mothers worldwide now breathe a sigh of relief that their boys won’t be sent off to die for that strip of land."
  kev_france.13.a:0 "Another victory for France."

  kev_france.14.t:0 "War For Wallonie"
  kev_france.14.d:0 "Recent French demands for Wallonie seem to have escalated to full-scale war, as the West German Federation has declared their intentions to defend the province till the last drop of blood. Both sides have mobilized their forces, and offensives are expected to begin any day. The Austrian government has issued a statement of neutrality, so long as French demands are limited to only Wallonie."
  kev_france.14.a:0 "The Rhine is the birthplace of conflict."

  kev_france.15.t:0 "The French Golden Age"
  kev_france.15.d:0 "We ruled supreme in the late 18th and early 19th century. Our army was the largest in the globe, the sun never set on our fearsome empire, and the metropol bustled with business and commerce. This period has come to be known as “The French Golden Age”, our nation’s period of complete and uncontested domination. The highlight of our grandeur was..."
  kev_france.15.a:0 "We sowed the seeds of a strong economy."
  kev_france.15.b:0 "We created new military doctrines, spreading our influence across the globe."
  kev_france.15.c:0 "Our prestige skyrocketed, making us the clear global power."

  kev_france.16.t:0 "Downfall"
  kev_france.16.d:0 "But our infamy outgrew our ability to contain our enemies. A single succession crisis in the mid-19th century brought our nation crashing down, and our hard work was torn from us in a few short decades. Of the humiliating losses we suffered during these years, the greatest was..."
  kev_france.16.a:0 "Wallonie, seized by the cowardly Germans!"
  kev_france.16.b:0 "Malaya, stolen by upstart natives!"
  kev_france.16.c:0 "Floride, snatched by a vicious noble!"

  kev_france.17.t:0 "Embers Alight"
  kev_france.17.d:0 "Yet even embers can spark anew, giving birth a flame even brighter than the first. The French people never lost hope in these long years, and put their faith in the hard work and dedication that had once made the nation so great. First, the monarchy and their lackeys were removed from power, kept only as symbols of a bygone age. The newly born republic then threw itself into a brutal campaign of revanchism, reversing Italian gains in the south and stabilizing what remained of the empire overseas. When we remember these brutal wars, one section of the armed forces always seems to come to mind..."
  kev_france.17.a:0 "Our army proudly marched once more."
  kev_france.17.b:0 "Our navy sailed the seven seas, protecting what remains of the empire."
  kev_france.17.c:0 "Our young air force ruled the skies, bombing enemies from above."
